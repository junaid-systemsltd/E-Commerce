# Next.js 13 E-commerce Project

Welcome to the Next.js 13 E-commerce project! This project is a work in progress and aims to create a fully functional e-commerce website. So far, we have completed the authentication, login, registration, add to cart, checkout, and place an order functionality. We will continue working on the admin-side features, including product, order, and user management.
